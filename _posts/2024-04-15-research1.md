## The Challenge

Kaggle competition [Eedi - Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pablomarino/dspy-baseline) asked for the design and development of an AI system for autonomous finding of misconceptions when grading multiple choice Math exams.

## My Solution

I developed an LLM System that indexed all the possible misconceptions in a vector database (Qdrant) and when grading a multiple choice question, used a series of LLM prompts to translate each wrong answer into a search query that could find the top 10 most likely misconceptions.

## The Outcome

The accuracy of my system was on par with other competitors' baselines, which was my goal since this was a baseline system. The value proposition of my solution was the use of Stanford's DSPY Framework for prompt optimization. My notebook reached Bronze medal on Kaggle and allowed me to develop a better understanding of DSPY framework. I shared my findings in a [tweet](https://x.com/pablomarino_com/status/1858288813035933705) where the Author of the framework replied.
