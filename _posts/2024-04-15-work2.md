## The challenge

My client, a Silicon Valley startup, already owns a proprietary search engine for technical support. They wanted to build an autonomous agent capable of using that search engine to resolve support tickets autonomously, similar to human agents. The agent needed to be configurable so it could be easily deployed for different clients.


## My solution


I developed a framework that uses a TOML configuration file containing customer-specific details. The system monitors Jira for new ticket submissions and utilizes various tools to guide users toward solutions, including:

Internal search functionality
Slack messaging to specific internal teams
Automated ticket commenting

## The outcome

The project resulted in a working prototype that successfully resolved low-complexity tickets autonomously.
