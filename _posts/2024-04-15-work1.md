## The challenge

A client developing a search engine for college students needed to evaluate the effectiveness of different rerankers and hybrid search approaches within a tight timeline.


## My solution


I approached this project through several key steps:

* Developed a comprehensive testing set with carefully crafted queries designed to evaluate different aspects of the search system.
* Created an automated testing program that could process these queries and output detailed results in Excel format.
* Established a rigorous methodology for manual review and validation of query results.
* Implemented state-of-the-art (SOTA) rerankers and sparse embedding search to enhance keyword matching capabilities.
* Generated detailed search performance reports for each system configuration.

## The outcome

After thorough analysis of the test results, we discovered that implementing a specific reranker improved search accuracy by 22% without any performance regressions. Based on these findings, we deployed the enhanced configuration to production.
